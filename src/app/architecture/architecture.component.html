            <h2>ARCHITECTURE</h2>
            <p class="forpara">Architecture provides an opportunity to add beauty and structure to the world.
                And we aim to do exactly that! We create innovative designs that are user centric while maintaining
                harmony with the natural surroundings.
                In the schematic phase of architecture, we take inputs from the client, followed by research and
                analysis of the project plan to avoid any future obstacles.
                Our architects then begin the study of location, size and the interconnection of the spaces.
                This enables us to create a rough plan of the building.
                Furthermore, the realistic sketches made by our architects give a solid outlook of how the building will
                look when built.</p>

            <p class="forpara">In our architectural planning services, we consider and analyze the requirements of our
                clients to come
                up with the best approach to either refurbish an existing temple or to design a new one from scratch. We
                use state of the art technology to do so. With further analysis of the design and site, we recommend any
                changes for better feasibility. The architectural plans are designed using the latest technology for the
                most accurate results.</p>

                your requirements.
                There are numerous instances during the construction of a temple where the owners are unaware about the
                legal guidelines of that specific region or territory which might land them in a limbo. In a scenario
                like this, we serve as the middleman to guide you regarding the construction laws and various
                documentation processes through the construction period. We’re completely privy to the clauses and laws
                which are required before kick starting the development site. As a liaison consultant, we recognize
                which officer to approach, when to approach, as a result simplifying the procedure efficiently. And we
                have won some of these know-hows with a sizeable experience and marketplace studies, consequently rising
                as a winner within the competitive market of liaison offerings.</p>
